# loltqdm
This repository contains examples on using [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm) library. Also shows how one may extend it with lolcat script.

Examples were (with no issues luckily) presented during the Lightning Talk at [Noc Informatyka](http://nocinformatyka.pl) and [Pykonik #37](https://www.pykonik.org/37/#talk-turbo-progressbar-w-pythonie) in June 2018. 

*Note*: Mind that lolcat lib (here file is called `localolcat`) is available under beerware license. I guess I will have to buy a beer the creator if I ever meet him ;) 

## Installation and running

1. Clone
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. Run one of `tqX.py` files (e.g. `python tq0.py`)
